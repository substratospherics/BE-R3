          Instead of being truly blue, many blue organisms have physical
          features that create a blue iridescence.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Many creatures, including birds, fish, and insects, that seem blue
            actually have structural characteristics that give them a blue
            iridescence rather than being truly blue. The term "structural
            coloration" is used to describe this. Physical characteristics of an
            object rather than pigments, which form the basis of pigmentary
            coloration, are what give an object its color.
          </li>
          <li>
            When seen from various angles, an object develops iridescence, which
            causes it to appear to change colors. It is comparable to how a soap
            bubble changes colors in the light or how a CD reflects various
            colors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blue structural coloration gets its blue tint from how light reacts
            with an animal's feather, scale, or exoskeleton surface. These
            structures' surfaces are made up of layers of cells or scales that
            have been stacked such that they interfere with light in particular
            ways. Blue iridescence results from the interference-induced
            stronger reflection of some light wavelengths than of others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Therefore, these creatures have unique pigments or structures in
            their feathers, scales, or wings that give them the appearance of
            being blue. However, this hue is not a result of a blue pigment;
            rather, it results from the way light reflects off of these unique
            structures. As the light or your viewing angle changes, the color
            also changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            It may be difficult to understand the structural factors that
            contribute to this blue iridescence. For example, the blue hue is
            produced by the interaction of light with the exquisite pattern of
            some bird feathers. The feathers on these birds' bodies are layered
            one on top of the other, and each has a distinct refractive index.
            When light touches the feather, these layers interact with it,
            reflecting some light waves more strongly than others and giving the
            feather its blue hue.
          </li>
          <li>
            The blue hue is a result of light's interaction with the scales or
            exoskeletons of other species. These scales' or exoskeletons'
            surfaces have a number of ridges and grooves that scatter light in
            such a manner that certain wavelengths are reflected more strongly
            than others, giving the color blue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep in mind that the shimmering blue color is caused by the way
            light interacts with specific structural components and can vary
            depending on both the light source's position and the viewer's
            perspective.
